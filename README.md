# Etch A Sketch!

This is a simple Etch-A-Sketch project I have been working on using the Canvas API. It is still in a verly early stage and I do plan on implementing one or two more features or even improving it.
For now I am kind of satisfied with the results.

I took inspiration from WesBos' tutorial and his implementation, and after watching it once I decided to write it on my own without furter referncing the video, but the documentation instead.
